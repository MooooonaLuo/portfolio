                                    <p>Distance and Understanding is a digital interactive installation that reflects the process of knowing and understanding a person with the change of the psychological distance to that person. It is mainly composed by two parts, a distance sensor and an animation series. As viewers approach to the screen, they become more intimate to the person in the animation.</p>

                        <p>As social beings, we tend to behave in a way that conforms social norms and expectation when interacting with others, but deep down, we are more complex than we appear to be. In public, especially on social media, our behaviors are usually more performative, as we attempt to build self-identities that we wish to present to others. While in private, we are more likely to follow our instinct and to reveal vulnerability. It is meaningful to contemplate the process of how we know a person in our daily life, since it reflects the way we perceive the signs presented by others as well as the way we create signs to signify ourselves.</p>

                        <img class="mx-auto d-block small-img" src="image/d&u_3.png" alt="arduino,AE,Python">
                        <p>I employed Arduino, Adobe After Effects and Python to create this installation. It is mainly composed by two parts, a distance sensor and six clips of short animation in abstract hand-drawing style. Each clip is approximately two-second long and represents a different stage of knowing the animated person. The distance sensor measures the physical distance between the installation and the viewer, a concrete representation of the psychological distance between the viewer and the animated person.</p>
                        <p>As the distance changes, different clips will be triggered. When the viewer is standing far away from the installation, the animation only shows the person sharing their happy moments on social media or performing on the stage. As the viewer approaches to the installation, the more personal and vulnerable side of the person is revealed.</p>

                        <p>Jim Campbell is known for his LED light works such as Vertical Repixelated and 7344 Stills. He probed into questions of human perception via displaying videos on screens composed of LED lights. Contrary to my work, in Campbell's works, the further the audience stand from the screens, the clearer they see the whole picture, because they can only see meaningless LED light dots if standing too close to the screens. In an age when everyone is pursuing high resolution, Campbell provoked discussion on the relation between the quantity of information and human perception.</p>
