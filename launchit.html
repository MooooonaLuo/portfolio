                        <p>We interviewed 6 college students, asking about their decision-making process when seeking projects to join or recruiting people for their projects.

                        <p>Our product is targeted at two groups of users, students seeking projects to join and project leaders who hope to grow their teams through recruitment. We synthesized our findings in interviews and came up with two user personas.</p>

                        <p>To further understand the gap between users' goals and our initial design, we decided to conduct usability tests. We set up three research goals:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the user flow intuitive? </li>
                            <li>Do we provide adequate information for users to join projects?</li>
                            <li>Would project leaders like to use our products?</li>

                        <p>We conducted the usability tests with 6 users and acquired many valuable findings. With a solid base of usability tests, we became confident to create more significant changes in our design.</p>

                        <p>The first-time users couldn't understand what LuanchIt was for immediately.  </p>
                        <p><b id="toogether-highlight">&#128161; Solution:</b></p>
                        <p>The PM suggested adding documentation to introduce all functions of LaunchIt, but I believed that users wouldn't have the patience to read through it. Therefore, I designed a concise and eye-catching introduction to the key features and a short step-by-step tutorial.</p>

                        <p>Navigation was hard when tabs were scattered on vertical and horizontal navigation bars.

                        <p><b id="toogether-highlight">&#128161; Solution:</b></p>
                        <p>We combined them into one navigation bar, explored 5 variations of information hierarchies, and tested them with users to find out which one was the most intuitive. Usersâ€™ mental models were very different from mine since many favored the version that I didnâ€™t think would work at first.</p>

                        <p>Users were reluctant to fill in their profiles during the onboarding, while complete profiles were crucial for them to connect.</p>
                        <p><b id="toogether-highlight">&#128161; Solution:</b></p>
                        <p>When signing up, users are only required to fill out basic information and can either complete their profiles or skip this part. If they choose to skip, the system will later encourage them to complete profiles when applying for positions. The profile page also shows the level of completion to increase their motivation.</p>

                        <p><b id="toogether-highlight">&#128161; Solution:</b></p>
                        <p>We restructured the post, dividing the content into more digestible pieces. With a clear structure, project seekers could easily find all information that mattered to them. We guided post creators to list the details step by step. In addition, they can add project logos and images to introduce their projects and teams, making the post more visually attractive.</p>

                        <p>The recruitment process used to be complicated. Project leaders needed to switch between tools, such as Google Forms, Emails, and Excel. </p>
                        <p><b id="toogether-highlight">&#128161; Solution:</b></p>

                        <p>I created a very detailed style guide to ensure style consistency throughout all pages and for maintenance. It specifies the use of colors in different conditions and includes components that are used frequently .</p>

                        <p>My main takeaway from this project is the strategy of efficiently collaborating with computer engineers during product development. I used to deliver my design to front-end developers until I completed a cycle of user interviews, usability tests, and prototypes. In this way, the team did not use time wisely, as developers needed to wait for my design. In contrast, at LaunchIt, we streamlined the process through frequent and concise communication between designers and developers. As the design lead, I worked with the PM to prioritize tasks for feature implementation.</p>
