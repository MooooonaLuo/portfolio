                        <p>People usually don't take their chronic pain seriously until it gets unbearable. After they begin to develop healthy habits, their motivation goes up and down, keeping them from sticking to the care routine. When their pain improves, their motivation decreases, and they abandon the healthy routine.</p>
                        <p>How do we change user behavior?

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">Early testing with storyboards</h2>
                        <p>We created a storyboard and presented it to four users to check if our solution appealed to them. They expressed disapproval of having employees bet their own money to join challenges and <b id="toogether-highlight">expected employers to pay more for employees' wellness</b>. They were also <b id="toogether-highlight">concerned about privacy</b>. Therefore, we decided to have employers pay their employees tokens to join challenges (employers would be willing to pay more as long as the ROI is positive) and anonymize users in community forums.</b> </p>

                        <p>If the product were to be launched, we hoped to measure the success based on the participation rate, challenge completion rate, reduction in sick leave, and net promotor score. Those factors would be the direct indicators of how well our product achieved user and business goals.</p>

                        <p>The design process was a learning process. From knowing nothing about chronic pain to becoming more knowledgeable than the average, I constantly learned from online resources, people who manage chronic pain, and experts of wellness programs. </p>
                        <p>"Don't fall in love with your first design." I heard this advice many times, but putting it into action was harder than I thought. We had disagreements sometimes when deciding on design solutions. It was hard to abandon our own ideas. Eventually, we settled our arguments by testing concepts with users and researching. It was vital to stay objective and design with users instead of letting self-consciousness drive the design process. </p>
